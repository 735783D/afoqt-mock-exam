    passage: "The development of stealth technology has significantly enhanced the capabilities of modern military aircraft. Stealth aircraft are designed to minimize detection by radar, infrared, and other sensors. This is achieved through a combination of advanced materials, aerodynamic shapes, and specialized coatings. The F-22 Raptor, for example, uses a unique design with sharp angles and a radar-absorbent coating to scatter radar signals, making it nearly invisible to enemy radars. Stealth technology is particularly valuable for reconnaissance and strike missions, allowing aircraft to penetrate enemy defenses undetected. As a result, these aircraft can gather critical intelligence and deliver precision strikes with reduced risk of interception or engagement.",

    passage: "The principles of aerodynamics are fundamental to understanding how aircraft achieve flight. Lift, one of the four forces acting on an aircraft, is generated by the wing's shape and the airflow over and under it. According to Bernoulli's principle, faster-moving air creates lower pressure, so the curved upper surface of a wing causes air to move faster and create lift. Thrust, provided by the aircraft's engines, propels the plane forward. Drag, the resistance caused by air, works against thrust, while weight, the force of gravity, pulls the aircraft down. Balancing these forces is crucial for stable flight. Pilots must continuously adjust the aircraft's control surfaces, such as ailerons and elevators, to maintain the desired flight path and altitude. This constant management of forces and surfaces is what allows aircraft to maneuver through the sky with precision and safety.",

    passage: "The principles of inertial navigation systems (INS) are essential for guiding aircraft and missiles without external references. INS relies on a set of gyroscopes and accelerometers to measure the vehicle's motion in all three dimensions. By continuously integrating these measurements, the system can calculate the vehicle's position, velocity, and orientation. This self-contained navigation method is particularly valuable in environments where GPS signals are unavailable or jammed. INS is often used in conjunction with other navigation systems, such as GPS and radar, to provide a more accurate and reliable navigation solution. As technology advances, INS systems are becoming more precise and compact, making them an indispensable tool for modern aviation and defense applications.",
