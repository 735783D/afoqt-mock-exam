    passage: "The principles of nuclear fission are fundamental to understanding how nuclear reactors generate power. Nuclear fission occurs when a heavy atomic nucleus, such as uranium-235, absorbs a neutron and splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy. This process also releases additional neutrons, which can then cause further fission events, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction. In a nuclear reactor, this chain reaction is carefully controlled using neutron-absorbing materials called control rods. The heat generated by fission is used to produce steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity. Nuclear power plants provide a significant portion of the world's electricity, offering a low-carbon energy source with high power density.",

    passage: "The principles of quantum computing are revolutionizing the field of information technology. Unlike classical computers, which use bits to represent data as 0s or 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This property, known as superposition, allows quantum computers to perform complex calculations much faster than classical computers. Additionally, qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, regardless of distance. This entanglement enables quantum computers to solve certain problems, such as factoring large numbers or simulating molecular structures, that are currently infeasible for classical computers. As research progresses, quantum computing has the potential to transform fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and artificial intelligence.",

    passage: "The principles of aerodynamics are fundamental to understanding how aircraft achieve flight. Lift, one of the four forces acting on an aircraft, is generated by the wing's shape and the airflow over and under it. According to Bernoulli's principle, faster-moving air creates lower pressure, so the curved upper surface of a wing causes air to move faster and create lift. Thrust, provided by the aircraft's engines, propels the plane forward. Drag, the resistance caused by air, works against thrust, while weight, the force of gravity, pulls the aircraft down. Balancing these forces is crucial for stable flight. Pilots must continuously adjust the aircraft's control surfaces, such as ailerons and elevators, to maintain the desired flight path and altitude. This constant management of forces and surfaces is what allows aircraft to maneuver through the sky with precision and safety.",
